This project represents my first visceral encounter with the 'Gap' between an ideal model and messy reality. As team leader, this project was my attempt to recreate the perfection of fighter jets I admired, and its challenges ultimately guided me toward the deep questions of control engineering.

### What: The Challenge
The goal was to compete in the Pusan National University President’s Cup, a national-level competition requiring both high-speed stability and low-speed maneuverability. As the leader of a 4-member team, the challenge was to navigate the complete design-build-test lifecycle of a 1.6m wingspan fixed-wing aircraft to meet these demanding aerobatic requirements.

### How: Leading the Project Lifecycle

My role was to direct the team through a systematic engineering process, from initial analysis and digital design to hands-on fabrication and final flight testing.

### Why: A Formative Success & a Deeper Question

This project was both a tangible success and a pivotal learning experience that shaped my academic ambitions.

#### Final Flight & Competition Result
Our team's efforts culminated in a **4th place finish** in the Fixed-Wing Scale Aircraft Division. The aircraft successfully executed all planned aerobatic maneuvers, validating our design and build process.

#### Lessons Learned
When our meticulously designed aircraft faced unpredictable disturbances, I viscerally experienced the gap between theory and practice. This moved me beyond hardware fabrication and ignited my passion for control engineering—the art of understanding and mastering the unseen forces that govern a system's behavior. This project taught me that the real engineering challenge lies not just in creating an ideal model, but in making that model robust to the chaotic reality of the physical world.
