I am an undergraduate student at Northeastern University, pursuing a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Mathematics. My primary research interest lies in developing control architectures that can provably guarantee safety and performance for autonomous systems operating in uncertain, dynamic environments. This passion was ignited during my hands-on projects, where I experienced the visceral 'Gap' between ideal mathematical models and messy, unpredictable reality.

My goal is to pursue a Ph.D. where I can build a rigorous theoretical foundation for quantifying and compensating for this 'Lumped Uncertainty', turning internal controller conflicts into a rich source of information. I believe this is a key step toward achieving **Provably Safe Autonomy**.
