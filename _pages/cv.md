## Education

---
**Northeastern University** | Boston, MA
*Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering* | May 2026
* Minor in Mathematics
* GPA: 3.86/4.0

**Chung-Ang University** | Seoul, Korea
*Completed 3 Semesters of Mechanical Engineering* | August 2023
* GPA: 96.3/100

## Research Interests

---
Robust Control, Optimization, Nonlinear Dynamics, Data-Driven Science and Engineering

## Research Experience

---
**Controller for Quadrotor’s Aggressive Trajectory Tracking** | Boston, MA
*Independent Undergraduate Researcher (Advised by Prof. Rifat Sipahi)* | October 2024 - Present
* Proposed and developed a hybrid control architecture combining Differential Flatness (DF) feedforward and Sliding Mode Control (SMC) feedback to enhance robustness.
* Achieved up to an 11.6% reduction in maximum tracking error against a baseline SMC controller in high-fidelity SITL simulations.
* Critically diagnosed the limitations of signal-fusion, identifying model-plant mismatch as the root cause and leading to a strategic pivot in research direction.
* Hypothesized that the command 'Gap' should be exploited as a real-time signal representing 'lumped uncertainty’.
* Currently investigating a 2-DOF control framework to directly estimate and compensate for this uncertainty using a disturbance observer.

## Projects

---
**NU Robotics Club** | Boston, MA
*Quadruped Robot Leg Team Member* | September 2024 – February 2025
* Spearheaded the mechanical design and analysis for a 3-DOF robotic leg as the lead of a 3-member sub-team.
* Developed a high-fidelity, manufacturing-ready CAD model using SolidWorks, validated against structural load calculations.

**Chung-Ang Aerospace Club** | Seoul, Korea
*Fixed-Wing Team Leader* | March 2022 – August 2023
* Directed a 4-member team through the complete design-build-test lifecycle of a 1.6m wingspan aircraft, culminating in a **4th place finish** at a national-level competition.
* Oversaw airframe design, system integration, and fabrication using laser cutting and 3D printing.

## Honors and Awards

---
* **Finalist (4th Place)**, Pusan National University President’s Cup Creative Aerial Vehicle Competition
* **Brigade Commander's Commendation** (2), Republic of Korea Army
* **Battalion Commander's Commendation**, Republic of Korea Army
* **Dean’s List**, Northeastern University, Fall 2024, Spring 2025

## Skills

## Leadership and Mentorship Experience

---
**Squad Leader** | Republic of Korea Army | Yeoncheon-gun, Korea
*July 2020 – January 2022*
* Led a 7-member squad in high-stakes operations within the Korean DMZ, responsible for mission planning and risk assessment to ensure a zero-incident record.

**Founder and Leader, Interdisciplinary Reading Group** | Chung-Ang University | Seoul, Korea
*December 2022 – August 2023*
* Initiated and directed a reading group with students from diverse majors to analyze complex topics, fostering critical thinking and cross-disciplinary communication.

**Peer Tutor, Department of Mechanical Engineering** | Chung-Ang University | Seoul, Korea
*September 2022 – June 2023*
* Mentored peers in core mechanical engineering subjects, developing tailored teaching strategies to improve their academic performance.
